# Mortgage-Calculator
we can use this calculator to calculate the mortage there is one simple formula (M = P [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n â€“ 1] ) in that p stands for principle, r stands for monthly interest rate and n stands for duration in month, so in this project :-
1.we get the input as principle , annual interest and duration(year wise)
2.we need to calculate the monthly interest.(annual interest / 100 / 12)
3.calculate total months from the duration. (duration * 12)
